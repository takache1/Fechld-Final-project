The data for this project came from the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States that collects information on social attitudes, values, and demographics. The goal of this project was to analyze what factors shape people’s attitudes toward working mothers—specifically, whether respondents believe that a mother who works for pay can have just as warm and secure a bond with her children as one who does not. This question is important for understanding how gender roles and social norms influence beliefs about parenting and employment.

Operationalization

To measure attitudes toward working mothers, I used the GSS variable fechld. This item asks respondents whether they agree or disagree with the statement: “A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work.” This became my dependent variable, with agreement reflecting support for working mothers and disagreement signaling skepticism about their ability to bond with their children.

For political ideology, I used the variable polviews, which places respondents on a scale from extremely liberal to extremely conservative. This helps capture whether traditional or progressive values are associated with attitudes toward working mothers.

Gender was measured using the variable sex, coded as male or female. This allowed me to assess whether men and women differ in how they view the relationship between work and motherhood.

To assess exposure to working mothers, I used the variable maeduc—the respondent’s mother’s highest level of education—as a proxy. Higher maternal education levels are often associated with labor force participation, so this variable gives insight into whether growing up with a working mother shapes one’s beliefs.

I also included control variables for age, race, and education level (educ) to account for broader demographic trends. These variables help isolate the impact of identity and political values from general differences across the population.

All of these variables were selected to reflect competing theories about how exposure, identity, and ideology shape people’s attitudes toward motherhood and employment. Together, they help explain why some individuals support working mothers and others do not.
